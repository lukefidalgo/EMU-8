## EMU-8

Basic implementation of the CHIP-8 interpreter. My first Rust project and my first emulator. It currently does not have sound.

## Usage

Clone this repository with:

```
git clone https://github.com/lukefidalgo/EMU-8
```

then run:

```
cargo run -- <path to rom>
```

## ROMS

You can find ROMs to play around with here: https://github.com/kripod/chip8-roms

## Special thanks

This emulator was implemented with the help of this article: https://tobiasvl.github.io/blog/write-a-chip-8-emulator/ by Tobias V. Langhoff. If you ever want to write your own CHIP-8 emulator this is the resource to read.
